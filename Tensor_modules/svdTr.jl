 [U,S,Vd,dw] = svdTr (T,rankT,idU,Nkeep,Stol) % truncate by Nkeep and Stol
 [U,S,Vd,dw] = svdTr (T,rankT,idU,[],Stol) % truncate by Stol
 [U,S,Vd,dw] = svdTr (T,rankT,idU,Nkeep,[]) % truncate by Nkeep
 [U,S,Vd,dw] = svdTr (T,rankT,idU,[],[]) % not truncate (only the default tolerance Stol = 1e-8 is considered)
 [U,S,Vd,dw] = svdTr (.. ,'deg') % option to keep the degenerate states at trunction threshold

 Singular value decomposition of tensor such that T = U*diag(S)*Vd. (Note
 that it is not U*S*V' as in the Julia built-in function 'svd'.) If the
 truncation criterion is given, the tensors are truncated with respect to
 the largest singluar values.

 < Input >
 T : [tensor] Tensor.
 rankT : [number] Rank of T.
 idU : [integer vector] Indices of T to be associated with U. For example,
       if rankT == 4 and idU == [1 3], the result U is rank-3 tensor whose
       1st and 2nd legs correspond to the 1st and 3rd legs of T. The 3rd
       leg of U is associated with the 1st leg of diag(S). And Vd is
       rank-3 tensor whose 2nd and 3rd legs correspond to the 2nd and 4th
       legs of T. Its 1st leg is associated with the 2nd leg of diag(S).
 Nkeep : [number] The number of singular values to keep.
       (Default: Inf, i.e., no truncation)
 Stol : [number] Minimum magnitude of the singluar value to keep.
       (Default: 1e-8, which is the square root of double precision 1e-16)

 < Option >
 'deg' : If it is given, this funciton searches the largest gap in the log
       of singular values, from the (Ntr)-th largetst singular value to
       the ceil(Ntr*1.1)-th largest one. Use this option to avoid
       unintended symmetry breaking by truncation.
       (Default: off)

 < Output >
 U : [tensor] Tensor describing the left singular vectors. Its last leg
       contracts with diag(S). The earlier legs are specified by input
       idU; their order is determined by the ordering of idU.
 S : [vector] The column vector of singular values.
 Vd : [tensor] Tensor describing the right singular vectors. Its 1st leg
       contracts with diag(S). The later legs conserve the order of the
       legs of input T.
 dw : [tensor] Discarded weight (= sum of the square of the singular
       values truncated).

       changed to be optional.
